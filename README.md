A native Joomla system plugin that disables printing, text selection/copy,
image dragging, developer-tools keyboard shortcuts, and the browser's
right-click menu on the frontend — with an optional popup message or a
fully custom, ARIA-accessible context menu of your own.

Rebuilt from the ground up as a Joomla 6-native plugin (PSR-4,
`SubscriberInterface`, DI container via `services/provider.php`,
`WebAssetManager`), inspired by the discontinued Glimlag "Custom Right
Click for Joomla 3.X" extension.

## Features

- Apply rules to specific user groups only (or everyone)
- Disable printing (Ctrl/Cmd+P + print-output content hiding), delivered
  via an external stylesheet so it isn't dropped by a site's
  Content-Security-Policy the way an inline `<style>` can be
- Disable text selection & copying (form fields stay usable)
- Disable image dragging (and suppresses iOS/WebKit's long-press "Save
  Image"/"Save Video" callout, which right-click/drag prevention alone
  does not affect)
- Discourage saving the page (blocks Ctrl/Cmd+S only - the browser's own
  menu offers the same "Save page as..." action and cannot be blocked
  from a web page)
- Discourage developer-tools keyboard shortcuts (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I/J/C,
  Cmd+Opt+I/J/C, Ctrl/Cmd+U) - a minor deterrent, not a security measure;
  DevTools remain reachable via the browser's own menu regardless
- Skip protections on interactive elements by default (links, form
  fields, buttons, editable content) - keeps the normal "right-click a
  link to open it in a new tab" gesture and form usability intact;
  turn off to block truly everywhere
- Four right-click modes: default / disabled with popup / images-only
  (`<img>`/`<picture>` only by default, with opt-in toggles to also
  cover video and CSS background images) / fully custom menu
- Custom context menu builder: link or built-in action items (reload,
  copy URL, print, scroll to top, share), with icons, a `{url}` placeholder
  for links, and open-in-new-tab — no arbitrary code execution is possible
  anywhere in the plugin. Copy/share actions work on plain HTTP too (not
  just HTTPS), with a three-tier fallback (Clipboard API → execCommand →
  a manual, pre-selected "press Ctrl+C" box) so they never silently fail
- Full keyboard accessibility: focus trap in the popup, roving-tabindex
  arrow-key navigation in the custom menu, focus returned on close
- Touch-device long-press (500ms) opens the popup/custom menu the same
  way a desktop right-click does - needed because iOS Safari largely
  does not fire a `contextmenu` event on long-press at all
- Exclude specific components or URL paths from the plugin entirely
- Admin-defined custom keyboard shortcuts, with exact modifier matching
  and Ctrl/Cmd cross-platform support
- Additional CSS "exception selectors" so a custom widget or web
  component the built-in exemption list doesn't recognise can be added
  without waiting for a plugin update
- Follows the site template's own light/dark theme (`data-bs-theme` /
  `data-color-scheme`) rather than the visitor's OS preference, respects
  `prefers-reduced-motion`, and uses logical CSS properties for RTL
  languages

## Installation

1. Download the latest release ZIP from the
   [Releases](https://github.com/ferino75/plg_system_fgcustomrightclick/releases)
   page.
2. In Joomla, go to **System → Install → Extensions** and upload the ZIP.
3. Enable the plugin under **System → Manage → Plugins** and search for
   "FG - Custom Right Click".

## Known limitations

- **"Disable text selection" and a template's own CSS.** This feature
  uses `user-select: none !important` with a boosted-specificity
  selector, which reliably wins against most template CSS - but a
  template rule that uses an ID selector (e.g.
  `body #main-content p { user-select: text !important; }`) will still
  win, because CSS specificity always ranks ID selectors above any
  number of class selectors, regardless of `!important`. There is no
  selector this plugin could ship that is guaranteed to beat an
  arbitrary, unknown competing stylesheet. If your specific template
  still allows selection where you don't want it, the fix has to happen
  in that template's own CSS: add a matching-or-higher-specificity
  override there, or remove/adjust its rule.

## Requirements

Joomla 4, 5, or 6.

## License

GPL-2.0-or-later. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Development

The `tests/` directory has the full behavioural/unit test suite (jsdom
for JS, reflection-based for PHP) referenced throughout CHANGELOG.md.
See `tests/README.md` for how to run it. These are development tooling
only and are not part of the Joomla install ZIP.

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
